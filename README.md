# Predictive-Credit-Score-Classification-Model-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks

### Objective
<p align="justify">
The primary objective of this project is to establish a robust predictive credit score classification model by employing a combination of machine learning techniques and neural networks. A diverse range of customer features, including but not limited to annual income, age, occupation, and payment behavior, will be analyzed by the model to categorize individuals into credit score classes such as "Good," "Bad," or "Standard." By exploring a comprehensive dataset encompassing various financial parameters, the aim is to develop an accurate and reliable tool for assessing creditworthiness. This tool will provide valuable insights for risk management and decision-making in the financial domain and help companies take data-driven decisions.</p>

### Stakeholders
<p align="justify">
The analysis is anticipated to draw attention from various parties, including banks, financial institutions, credit card companies, and individuals seeking loans or credit. The implementation of the predictive credit score classification model is expected to provide a reliable means of assessing the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. Through the consideration of various factors such as annual income, age, occupation, and payment behavior, individuals are categorized into credit score classes, including "Good," "Bad," or "Standard." A thorough analysis of a diverse dataset containing financial information is done using machine learning and neural networks. This tool is deemed a valuable resource for stakeholders, aiding them in making well-informed decisions in areas such as risk management and financial planning. Additionally, the model can be utilized by individuals to check their own credit scores, enabling them to make informed choices for significant financial commitments, such as purchasing homes or vehicles.</p>
